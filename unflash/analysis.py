"""WCAG 2.x / PEAT-style flash analysis.

Method:
  1. Frames are downscaled to a model of the content viewed at 1024x768
     (analysis_scale of that, default 1/4 => window 341x256 becomes ~85x64).
  2. Per pixel, sRGB is linearized; relative luminance L and the saturated-red
     value V = max(0, R-G-B)*320 are tracked through a per-pixel extremum
     tracker, so a flash ramping over several frames still counts as one
     transition (accumulated monotonic change, with a small noise deadband).
  3. When a pixel's direction reverses, the completed swing qualifies as a
     luminance transition if |swing| >= swing_threshold and the darker
     extremum < dark_threshold; as a red transition if |swing| > 20 on the V
     scale and either extremum was saturated red (R/(R+G+B) >= 0.8).
  4. Because pixels complete a multi-frame transition at slightly different
     times, completions are pooled over area_accum_window seconds. A frame
     produces a *transition event* (up or down, general or red) when pooled
     qualifying pixels cover >= area_fraction of any window_w x window_h
     region (sliding window via integral image).
  5. A *flash* is a pair of opposing transitions whose regions overlap
     (opposing changes in unrelated screen regions are motion, not flashing).
     Any 1-second period with more than `flash_limit` flashes (general or
     red, counted separately) is a violation.
  6. An *extended flash* is the same thing one step below the failure rate:
     flashes passing every criterion above (swing, dark state, concurrent
     area, coherent window mean) at exactly `flash_limit` per second, whose
     qualifying moments keep recurring (no gap longer than extended_hold)
     for >= 80% of a 5-second period. WCAG permits it; sustained flashing at
     the limit is an ITC/Ofcom hazard, so profiles with
     extended_mode="section" report it as a violation (its own work section,
     counted in the safe/unsafe verdict) and extended_mode="off" ignores it.

Timing: event positions are reported in the source's native pts (that is what
seeking/cutting uses), but flash-frequency windows run on an internal
monotonic clock that bridges source timestamp discontinuities.

# How long a pixel may go on accumulating one monotonic run before the run
# is re-anchored to where it has got to.
#
# The tracker exists so that a flash ramping over a few frames still counts as
# one transition. Left uncapped it will also add up a drift that takes half a
# minute -- a scene slowly brightening, a fade, a camera adjusting exposure --
# and report the whole accumulated swing as a "transition" the moment the
# pixel finally turns. Nothing that slow is a flash: a flash is a pair of
# opposing changes inside a second, so a swing that took longer than that
# cannot be half of one.
#
# It also makes the detector's memory finite, and that is what section
# editing rests on. A section is checked by starting the detector cold a
# little before it (see context_seconds); if a pixel's run can reach back
# arbitrarily far, the check measures its swing from a different value than
# a pass over the whole video does, and the two disagree -- a section that
# checks safe, fails on the exported file, and passes again when you put a
# fresh section over the spot and check that. Measured on real footage, a
# fifth of the picture was mid-run from more than six seconds earlier, some
# of it from twenty-six seconds earlier.
MAX_RUN_SECONDS = 2.0

# How much of the picture has to move before a frame counts as showing
# something new, as a fraction of the area a flash has to cover.
#
# A picture that is merely being held on screen again is not a fresh
# observation, and rendering produces a great many of them: a section is
# written onto a constant-rate grid (render._pick_grid_fps), so each source
# picture is repeated three to five times. Comparing frames for exact
# equality only catches the repeats an encoder happened to code as skips --
# measured on real 1080p renders, one in seven -- and the rest are counted
# as observations in their own right. That is what let a section pass its
# own check and then fail the render of the very same frames: the render
# samples the hazard five times as often, so it catches peaks the check
# steps over and stretches every burst by up to a frame.
#
# So "the same picture" is decided by how much of the picture has moved far
# enough to be part of a flash: pixels whose luminance differs by more than
# HELD_DELTA_RATIO of swing_threshold from the last frame that was *not*
# held, or whose red value (R-G-B on the 0..320 scale) differs by more than
# HELD_DELTA_RATIO of red_delta_threshold -- a saturated red swapped for a
# grey of the same luminance moves no luminance at all and is still a new
# picture (and a red flash). Comparing against the last distinct frame
# rather than the previous one is what keeps a slow ramp accumulating
# instead of being held for ever
# -- but it also means an encoder's drift accumulates, which is why the bar
# is on magnitude rather than on the tracker's own noise deadband. x264
# codes the first copy of a new picture roughly and refines it over the
# copies that follow, so the third copy can differ from the first across
# hundreds of pixels while none of them has moved anywhere near a flash.
#
# Measured over 2417 known repeats in three rendered 1080p sections: drift
# from the first copy of a picture moved at most two pixels past the delta,
# while a genuine picture change moved a median of 4672 and a qualifying
# flash has to move area_thresh (1360 here). Both margins are wide.
HELD_DELTA_RATIO = 0.5      # of swing_threshold: well under a qualifying
                            # swing, well over anything compression does

        Each qualifying strobe holds the content "flashing" for
        `extended_hold` seconds, so the separate strobe moments of a real
        3 Hz flicker join up, while a one-off transition decays after a
        second and cannot fill a 5-second window on its own.

        Both the coverage and the search over window positions are measured
        in the time domain rather than over frames, which is what makes the
        verdict depend on the footage and not on how densely the file
        carrying it happens to sample it. Frames are not evenly spaced:
        rendering re-times a section onto a constant-rate grid (see
        render._pick_grid_fps), so a rendered section carries three or four
        times the frames per second of the untouched material either side of
        it, and plenty of sources -- screen and game captures especially --
        are variable-rate to begin with. Counting frames lets the dense side
        of a window outvote the sparse side several times over, reading
        flashing as far more sustained than it is; sampling window positions
        at frame times lets a dense file find peaks a sparse one steps over.
        Either one is enough for a section its own check calls safe to fail
        once it has been rendered, on what is frame for frame the same
        footage.

    A pixel's monotonic run reverses at most once per frame (_ExtremaTracker

    A verdict needs `k` flashes inside a second, timed by their closing
    transitions: the first closes on one picture, and the `k - 1` flashes
    after it cost two pictures each. The flashes are therefore spread over at
    least 2 * (k - 1) frame intervals, whatever those pictures contain --
    and if that many consecutive intervals cannot fit inside a second, the
    verdict cannot be reached.

    `k` is `_FlashCounter.K` = floor(flash_limit) + 1 for a WCAG failure

    flash (at the limit), where the profile reports those. The smaller
    window governs: satisfying it satisfies the longer one, which contains
    it.
