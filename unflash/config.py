"""Detector and pipeline configuration.

WCAG 2.x / PEAT reference thresholds:
  - general flash: pair of opposing relative-luminance changes >= 0.10 of max,
    darker state < 0.80, covering >= 1/4 of any 341x256 window at 1024x768
  - red flash (WCAG 2.2, and 2.1 as now published): pair of opposing
    transitions, each to or from a state with R/(R+G+B) >= 0.8, whose states
    are more than 0.2 apart in the CIE 1976 UCS diagram (u'v')
  - failure: more than 3 flashes (of either kind) in any 1-second period
  - extended flash: >= 5 s of flashing that meets every failure criterion
    except the rate — it runs *at* the permitted rate (flash_limit per
    second) rather than above it. Not a WCAG failure, but sustained flashing
    at the limit is an ITC/Ofcom hazard and still affects some viewers.

Profiles:
  wcag_flag_extended_config()  exact WCAG thresholds, extended flashes flagged
                               as fixable sections (the default)
  wcag_config()                exact WCAG only; extended flashes are neither
                               detected nor reported
  strict_config()              tighter thresholds for extra margin (lower
                               swing/area, 2 flashes/s). No extended flagging:
                               strict already *fails* content at 3 flashes/s,
                               which is the only rate at which the extended
                               test separates flashing from ordinary motion —
                               at its own 2/s band, scrolling credits and
                               shot-cut dialogue are indistinguishable from
                               flashing by any per-pixel or window-mean
                               measure.
