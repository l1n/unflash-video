// Triage: where in a film to look first. From what the file's index already
// holds (every frame's size and which frames are keyframes), with nothing
// decoded, each chunk of a scan (analysis.js scanChunks) gets a score for how
// likely it is to hold flashing: a picture that changes all over costs an
// encoder many bits, and encoders start a new GOP at a scene cut, which a
// flash looks like to them. A scan takes the likeliest chunks first, so that
// what flashes turns up early; what it finds does not depend on the order
// (every frame is still decoded and checked, and the runs are joined
// exactly), and the scores say nothing about what is safe.
