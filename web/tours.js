// What the guided tour says, and when it comes. A first visit gets the
// getting-started tour in three parts, each the first time its part of the
// app is on screen: the start page, then the first video, then the first
// section. Coming back after an update, each change that brought something
// to see gets a short tour of its own (CHANGELOG.md names it:
// `<!-- HH:MM tour:id -->`), again once its part of the app is on screen.
// A tour starts only when nothing else is going on (no job running, no
// dialog open, no click or key in the last moment), each one once; the
// guide has the whole tour again, and What's new a "show me" for each.
