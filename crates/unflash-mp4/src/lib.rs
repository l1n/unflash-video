//! Small container readers and an MP4 writer, built for WebCodecs. The
//! readers (MP4 / QuickTime from the `moov` box and the `moof` boxes of
//! fragmented files; Matroska / WebM from its clusters) produce per-track
//! codec strings, decoder descriptions and sample tables (offset, size,
//! dts, pts, sync), driven by byte ranges so a browser can serve them from
//! a `Blob` without loading the file; the writer takes encoded chunks back
//! and produces a playable file.
//!
//! Nothing here decodes media.
