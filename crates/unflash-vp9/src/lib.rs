//! A pure-Rust VP9 video decoder, for the Unflash web app to read VP9 files
//! in browsers whose WebCodecs has no VP9 decoder, and to add decoding
//! capacity next to a hardware decoder.
//!
//! Supported: profile 0 (8-bit 4:2:0) and profile 2 (10 and 12-bit 4:2:0),
//! with every coding tool of those profiles: key, inter and intra-only
//! frames, hidden frames in superframes and `show_existing_frame`, the four
//! probability contexts with their resets and backward adaptation,
//! segmentation (tree and temporally predicted maps, all four features),
//! the loop filter with its mode and reference deltas, delta quantisers and
//! lossless coding, tiles, every block size and partition, all transforms,
//! compound prediction, switchable interpolation filters and frame size
//! changes predicted from scaled references. Profiles 1 and 3 (4:2:2, 4:4:0
//! and 4:4:4) are reported as unsupported.
//!
//! The decoder is written to the VP9 Bitstream & Decoding Process
//! Specification (v0.6/v0.7) and tested bit-exact against ffmpeg's decoder
//! on libvpx streams that exercise these tools (`tests/`), and against the
//! libvpx test vectors (`examples/conformance.rs`).
