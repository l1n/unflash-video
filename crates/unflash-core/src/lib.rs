//! Photosensitive flash detection with WCAG 2.x / PEAT semantics.
//!
//! This crate is the portable heart of Unflash. It holds everything that
//! does not touch a GPU, a codec or a browser:
//!
//! * [`config`] — thresholds and the three profiles.
//! * [`pixel`] — the per-pixel state machine (monotonic-run trackers, flash
//!   pairing, rate rings) written so that the GPU shader in `unflash-gpu`
//!   and the CPU kernels here are the *same algorithm on the same integer
//!   clock*, and can be compared bit for bit.
//! * [`grid`] — the sliding-window geometry and the per-frame statistics
//!   that the pixel stage hands to the temporal stage.
//! * [`temporal`] — the window-mean coherence gate, event and hazard
//!   bookkeeping, and the final verdict (violations, extended flashes).
//! * [`sections`] — turning violations into padded work sections, the safe
//!   frame-rate bound, and the run-up length a section check needs.
//! * [`editing`] — replacement maps, edited timelines, thinning, the
//!   keep-light / keep-dark suggester and the classification of a check's
//!   violations relative to the section.
//! * [`detector`] — the [`detector::Detector`] that ties a pixel stage to the
//!   temporal stage, plus the fully-CPU [`detector::CpuDetector`].
//!
//! The reference behaviour is the Python implementation in `unflash/`
//! (see `DETECTION.md`); differences are documented where they exist.
